    description: "If temples were to be ranked based on sheer spiritual magnetism, the Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi would unquestionably take the first place. Sitting on the western bank of the holy Ganges, Shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple is more than a place of worship; it is a getaway to the divine being. Over time, devotees have been drawn to this sacred place, carrying prayers, hopes and a deep yearning for liberation (moksha). Kashi Vishwanath Temple Varanasi is among the twelve Jyotirlingas and is observed as the most sacred home of Lord Shiva. A visit here is equivalent to stepping inside his world, where the worries leave the abode, and the hustle gives way to the soothing sounds of mantra chanting and the gentle ringing of temple bells."
